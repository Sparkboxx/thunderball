The python module esc.py contains the class definition for an ESC like the ones we got from Hobbyking.

The schematics for connecting the ESC to Arduino/BeagleBone are in ESCservo.fzz.

Functionality:

The speed is controlled by sending the appropriate PWM signal to the signal (yellow) cable of the ESC.
A typical ESC operates with duty cycle times within the range of 1-2 ms and accepts update frequencies in the range of ~ [30,150] Hz.
This means that:

   * The maximum throttle value is set by setting the duty cycle to 2000 μs or above
   * The ESC switches off the motor when the duty cycle is set to 1000 μs or below
   * The ESC will switch off if the update frequency is set below ~30 Hz
   * The ESC will ignore any additional pulses if update frequency is set above ~150 Hz
For the above reasons I choose (for now) to set the update frequency value at 100 Hz and the duty cycle min and max values to 900 and 2100 resp.

This will change in the future if a reason occurs.
